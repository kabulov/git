it is a strange story...
after setting up a hg repo on a linux based server throught apache,
i was asked to set up a git repo for developers needs.
It is important to point out that I was newbie in git.

It turned out that there are several tools for that:
1. git-daemon - fast, git protocol
2. gitweb - with interface and other fancynesses

hg server allows to specify port, ip, user, group, pid file and others.
same for git-daemon, so i opted to set up a repo using it.

then there were many small and big misunderstandings of this tool in the following order of research:
1. it uses git:// - its own protocol. Not http:// 
2. mkdir repo
3. cd repo
4. git [--bare] init --shared=true
(--bare or 7.)
5. touch git-daemon-export-ok
6. git daemon \
--verbose --base-path=/path-to-hg-and-git-repos/git/ \
--enable=receive-pack --pid-file=/var/run/git-daemon.pid --informative-errors
7. git checkout -b repo 
(here new branch 'repo', master remains)
(use this or --bare when init)
